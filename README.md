# 🔍 Filter Data – React

The Filter Data App is a React-based application that dynamically filters a list of items based on user-typed words. With clean state management and event handling, it allows users to view specific data subsets instantly. 

The goal of this project was to gain practical experience in filtering arrays in React, conditional rendering, and managing stateful UI.
